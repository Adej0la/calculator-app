## About

A simple React app that will execute simple arithmetic operations

## What I learned

I learnt about the `useReducer` hook and how it takes a `reducer` and an initial state as input and outputs the current state and a `dispatch` method. This `dispatch` method 'dispatches' action to the reducer which then modifies existing state based on the action type (`action.type`)

I also learnt to use the `Intl.NumberFormat` method to format the integer so that commas are placed appropriately as an integer increases.
